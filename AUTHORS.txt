Most parts of the QBzr plugin were written by Lukáš Lalinský 
<lalinsky at gmail dot com>.

The idea of an UI for Bazaar commands comes from bzr-gtk plugin by 
Jelmer Vernooij <jelmer at samba dot org>.

The Bazaar icons, data/bzr-16.png and data/bzr-48.png, are from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/LogoOptions.
