QBzr plugin was written by Lukáš Lalinský <lalinsky@gmail.com>.

The idea of an UI for Bazaar commands comes from bzr-gtk plugin by 
Jelmer Vernooij <jelmer@samba.org>. Also some bzr-gtk code is used 
in this plugin.

The Bazaar icons, data/bzr-16.png and data/bzr-48.png, are from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/LogoOptions.

Icons data/folder.png and text-x-generic.png are from Tango Desktop
Project (http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project).
